              Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study
              exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances
              are as follows, with definitions:

              <dd class="standart-paragraph">
                A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
                300BC. a whole village would dance around in a circle like
                chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.

              <dt class="standart-paragraph">Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
              <dd class="standart-paragraph">
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
                they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close
                together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies
                around in impcrccptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my
                fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                modem styles such as Twerking.

                An interesting example of historic misinformation. English
                explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance
                style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being
                practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
                however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
                because they were really cold.
